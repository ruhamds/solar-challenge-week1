## Project Description

This project involves setting up a development environment and performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on solar datasets. The goal is to prepare the data for subsequent analysis, which will likely involve comparing solar data across different countries.

## How to Reproduce the Environment

To reproduce the development environment, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anasimos/solar-challenge-week1.git 
    cd solar-challenge-week1
    ```
2.  Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .env # For venv
    # or
    conda create -n myenv python # For conda
    ```
3.  Activate the virtual environment:

    * **venv (Linux/macOS):**

        ```bash
        source .env/bin/activate
        ```

    * **venv (Windows):**

        ```bash
        .env\Scripts\activate
        ```

    * **conda:**

        ```bash
        conda activate myenv
        ```
4.  Install the project dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
